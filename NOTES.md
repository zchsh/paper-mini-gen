# Project Notes

## Next steps

- [ ] Think through new tool layout and workflow
  - Maybe worth doing in Figma? Sketching on paper, as always, probably a nice place to start

- [ ] Clean up `imagetracejs-remixes`
  - I'm not concerned about this for now, cause it's working fine for my purposes... if I had to worry about abstracting all the cases in which it'd probably break, that'd be another story, but for now I think I can just not care.

### Later

#### Replace example images with NOT random art ripped from the internet

- [ ] Replace example images with NOT random art ripped from the internet
  - It's been fine and has felt okay during development, but doesn't feel right if I'm going to share this tool at all
  - Original art might be fun, alternately, look up creative commons or public domain work and attribute it
  - Steamboat Willie's in the public domain, that'd be fun, and call attention to public domain stuff which i love

#### Reconsider offset ordering for better consistency

- [ ] Reconsider offset ordering for better consistency
  - Currently I think it's, offset first, scale after?
  - Maybe it should be... scale first, then offset?
  - Cause as is... a "tall" piece of art will get scaled down less, and the offset therefore looks thicker... where a "short" piece of art gets scaled down a lot, and the offset gets scaled down as well, and thus looks thinner
  - This would be a relatively significant refactor, so seems to make sense to clean things up first.

#### Explore path smoothing after boolean addition

- [ ] Explore path smoothing after boolean addition
  - Currently, scissors-based cutout is kinda not realistic with the actual path
  - Would be nice to be able to smooth out... not sure how to do this while ensuring offset? Maybe there's some kind of algorithm that ensures the area doesn't decrease? Like a kind of 2D shrink-wrap?
  - <https://www.smoothsvg.com/> is a starting point
    - this was the first search result, could probably dive deeper
  - also this: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/28722732>
  - Want it to be easy to cut out the shapes
  - Path smoothing of some kind might help with that
  - 2025-04-13 at 18:05 - stubbedin `demo-smooth-to-polyline`
  - 2025-05-10 at 10:27 - there's a Figma plugin for this that might be worth trying: <https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/809139536998662893/simplify>. Might make sense to set up "Copy SVG" at every step for debug purposes... then you can test the smoothing process in Figma, see if it works, and if it does and the plugin is licensed appropriately, swipe the code and integrate it here.

#### Consider post-trace option to "remove interior voids"
  
- I've been thinking about doing _line drawings_. This would leave significant "holes", or interior shapes, within a larger main shape.
- Could there be an option to remove these interior voids? Option to remove them completely could make sense.
- Another way to implement this option, more manual maybe a separate thing, would be manual removal of specific shapes, eg by clicking on them and having them change colour
- Possible first cut option... a given polygon is made up of many REGIONS. Group the regions of a given polygon based on whether they overlap - any overlapping regions should be placed in a single group. Determining overlap might be done with a "minowski diff"? <https://sourceforge.net/p/jsclipper/wiki/documentation/#clipperlibclipperminkowskidiff>. In longer form, running an intersection of the two regions, and then determining whether the intersection has a surface area greater than zero might be another option. Once you have a group of overlapping regions, then determine the surface area of each region, with <https://sourceforge.net/p/jsclipper/wiki/documentation/#clipperlibjsareaofpolygon>. Finally, sort by surface area, and keep only the region with the largest surface area.

#### Support "backside" images

- Requires more art, but really adds something I think, and could maybe encourage hand-drawing over AI tool use, eg see <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehjWZRPq9JA>
- Totally optional
- Art has to kind of match up from front to back in terms of shape... cutout from front would always be used.

#### Consider alternate approach to centering traced shapes

As-is, traced polygons are centered with "offset" based on their bounding box... which kind of works, but feels like it could be better.

What if you found the "center of mass" of the incoming polygon, and used that as a "base" offset? The input offset could be applied on top of that "base" offset.

#### Stub in documentation

- <https://documentation.js.org/>

#### Clean up demos

- Many are no longer relevant, i think, since have swapped in a few libraries

#### Look into performance

- Seems to have gotten better since swapping Jimp in and ripping out ImageJS

#### Final packaging

- [ ] Final packaging as a `.zip` file with an `index.html` etcetera
  - Could also build into a single `.html` file with simple `@include` style assembly, a la Mustache... self container "app" that runs in your browser, even offline! Zero external dependencies... pretty cool!
  - Could then share this with folks... creative commons etc
  - At this point, final tool exporting a single mini outline as `.svg` seems most feasible... embed the original image in the SVG as a `dataURI`
  - Stretch goal might be using `<canvas />` to render the outline `.svg` and the original image to a `.jpeg` or `.png`. Transparent-supporting `.png` in particular is interesting, as it would be nice to be able to place characters close together... but might need to use the offset-and-outlined path as a mask... Seems feasible, even if it could get a little messy!

#### Separate arrangement tool

- [ ] Consider arrangement of "results" on page...
  - maybe let them be dragged around, even rotated?
  - nah... seems to make more sense to have this as a separate tool
  - character mini generator should render to `.svg`, or to `.jpeg` or `.png`. The exported asset can then be placed and duplicated in other programs (eg Figma). If I happen to want to create an HTML-based standalone program that lets you arrange imported `.svg`, `.png`, and `.jpeg` files on a page, that might be cool. But, can be completely separate from the "paper minis" generator.
