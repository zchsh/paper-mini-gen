      in the red heart not showing up at all when printing to PDF. This approach
      still works in the browser, and even displays correctly in the print
      dialog, but once the PDF is exported the red heart is gone. -->

      enough, macOS Finder's little icon preview doesn't seem to handle it
      correctly, displaying a full red heart rather than applying the clipPath
      properly.  -->
