      <!-- Line below doesn't fully work, read on as to why -->
      <!-- <use href="#myCircle" /> -->

      <!-- 🐛 Including a <use /> referencing #myCircle within this clipPath,
      as commented out above, doesn't seem to work properly.
      
      It seems to result in the red heart not showing up at all when printing
      to PDF. This approach still works in the browser, and even displays
      correctly in the print dialog, but once the PDF is exported the red heart
      is gone. Chrome and Safari both seem to handle this correctly.

      Filed a bug with Firefox:
      https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1972006
      
      As a workaround, #myCircle can be declared within the clipPath, and
      re-used outside of the clipPath. This achieves the same result as being
      able to declare #myCircle outside the clipPath... but it feels a lot
      less intuitive, and if you wanted to re-use the definition within 
      multiple clipPaths then you can-->

      <circle id="myCircle" cx="40" cy="35" r="35" />
    </clipPath>
  </defs>
  <!-- Black heart, also acts as shape reference for the red heart -->
  <path id="heart" d="M10,30 A20,20,0,0,1,50,30 A20,20,0,0,1,90,30 Q90,60,50,90 Q10,60,10,30 Z" />
  <!-- Red heart, clip it using the clipPath with the circle shape -->
  <use href="#heart" fill="red" clip-path="url(#myClip)"  />
  <!-- Can reference the circle shape again -->
  <use href="#myCircle" x="0" y="0" fill="none" stroke="magenta" stroke-width="4" />
