			<details>
				<summary>What are paper miniatures?</summary>
				<p>
					<em>Miniature figurines</em> have a long history in games and
					storytelling. Think of chess pieces and ceramic dolls, hand puppets
					and marionettes. By bringing a physical item into existence, we can
					hold a small part of the story we're telling in our hands.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Paper miniatures</em> are a particularly easy way to create little
					physical representations of characters and creatures. They're commonly
					associated with
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game"
						>tabletop role-playing games</a
					>
					like Dungeons & Dragons.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can use paper miniatures however you like. You could make your own
					paper chess set, prototype a new board game, or print some little
					characters from whatever book you're reading.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>How can I print an SVG?</summary>
				<p>
					You'll need an app that lets you paste an SVG from your clipboard,
					arrange it on a page, and export the page as a PDF. You can usually
					fit many different miniatures on a single page.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> is likely the easiest
					option if you're new to vector editing tools, although it requires an
					account, and it's been increasingly hard to avoid subscription
					payments since Adobe acquired it.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> is another option, it's
					free and open-source, but might have a bit more of a learning curve.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you're printing a single miniature, you may be able to open the SVG
					file in your browser, and print to a PDF from your browser's print
					dialog.
				</p>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>What kind of paper should I use?</summary>
				<p>
					Standard printer paper should be fine. You'll be folding the paper
					miniature so that every part is made up of two layers of paper and one
					layer of glue, so even thinner paper ends up pretty sturdy.
				</p>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>How do I assemble a paper mini?</summary>
				<p>You'll need scissors and a glue stick.</p>
				<p>
					First cut along the solid lines. You don’t have to be exact unless you
					want to, making precise cuts takes practice. Then fold along the
					dotted lines. Valley fold are marked with dotted lines, and mountain
					folds are marked with dash-dot lines.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you’re done each individual fold, fold everything into place to
					see how your paper miniature will look. To permanently assemble your
					miniature, unfold it, add glue to the entire back of the print, and
					then fold it back together and press things together.
				</p>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>What kinds of images can I use?</summary>
				<p>
					Please source your images responsibly. This tool works with
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JPEG</a> and
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG">PNG</a> images. In theory
					other formats might work, but I haven't tested them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Images should have a plain white or transparent background. This is
					helpful for tracing, and also prints nicely. If you need a way to
					remove a background,
					<a href="https://www.remove.bg/">remove.bg</a> works well, the small
					image sizes you get for free are fine for miniature sized printing.
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>
					Images should be under 1000 pixels square, otherwise things might be
					really slow. If you need an online image resizing tool, many have
					annoying ads, but
					<a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/image/resize"
						>Adobe Express's resize tool</a
					>
					can be refreshing because it's just one giant ad for Adobe.
				</p>
				<p>
					If your image isn’t working as expected, you can try tweaking the
					silhouette related settings to see if that helps.
				</p>
			</details>

				<summary>Should I use AI-generated images?</summary>
				<p>Maybe not?</p>
				<p>
					Using generative algorithms to create artwork is a shortcut. I think
					it's important to consider what you’re cutting out, and the nature of
					the tools you’re using.
				</p>
				<p>
					By their nature, generative algorithms are based on existing images.
					To train these algorithms, for-profit companies download and process,
					without permission and without providing compensation, the creative
					work of many generations of hard-working artists. I think it's
					critically important to acknowledge the lifetimes of human labour that
					underpin these tools. The companies that build and sell these tools
					did not create the words and images that power them. These companies
					seem happy to compromise the livelihoods of the same people to whom
					they owe their existence, all in the name of (eventual?) profit for
					already-wealthy shareholders.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you use generative algorithms, you are cutting out the artist.
				</p>
				<p>
					It may be that some judge at some point in the future rules that
					training generative algorithms somehow falls under fair use, but
					legality is not morality, and laws in the digital space have
					<a
						href="https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/1353-the-naked-emperor/episode/16142603-introducing-understood-who-broke-the-internet"
						>a history of corruption</a
					>. Even the most transformative and beneficial inventions can be used
					in exploitative ways, and so far, generative algorithms seem squarely
					aimed at furthering wealth inequality and
					<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/02/despotism-on-demand/"
						>worker exploitation</a
					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may be cutting something else out too. The value proposition of
					generative algorithms is that they let you skip a good chunk of the
					creative process. You may find that hand-drawing your own art brings a
					different kind of connection and meaning to what you create. No matter
					how “bad” you might think you are as an artist, there’s no way to know
					what you’re missing until you’ve personally created something you feel
					happy with.
				</p>
				<p>
					I strongly believe that feeling happy with your own artwork doesn’t
					mean it needs to be “good” by any standard. I think that desire for
					“good” artwork, and protection from the feeling that we’re “bad” at
					something, is what drives us to use sloppy and exploitative generative
					tools in the first place.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you focus on a playful and forgiving creative process, you can bake
					your good feelings into whatever you make, even if it doesn’t have as
					much lipstick as what gets spit out of an image generator.
				</p>

				<summary>How can I support this project?</summary>
				<p>
					If you've gotten something out of the many hours of work that went
					into this tool, you can
					<a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/zchsh">say thanks with money</a>.
					It'll help me buy food and pay rent.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you'd like to contribute code or feedback, you can do that on
					GitHub, at
					<a href="https://github.com/zchsh/paper-mini-gen"
						>zchsh/paper-mini-gen</a
					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The spirit of this project is to make a tool that's free, open source,
					account-less, does one thing really well, and uses file formats that
					are highly interoperable, so that you can use it in combination with
					other tools. It's an attempt at taking a
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy"
						>Unix-like philosophy</a
					>
					to writing code for the web.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you like writing code, I'd love to hear your thoughts, or
					collaborate on tools with a similar philosophy. You can reach me at
					<a href="mailto:hi@zch.sh">hi@zch.sh</a>.
				</p>

			<details>
				<summary>Colophon &amp; thanks</summary>

					to maintainers of these libraries for making their work freely
					available.
