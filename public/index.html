			<details>
				<summary>What are paper miniatures?</summary>
				<p>
					Miniature figurines have a long history in games and storytelling.
					Think of chess pieces and ceramic dolls, hand puppets and marionettes.
					By bringing a physical item into existence, we can hold a small part
					of the story we're telling in our hands.
				</p>
				<p>
					Paper miniatures are an easy way to make those little physical
					representations of the characters and creatures in our stories.
					They're commonly associated with
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game"
						>tabletop role-playing games</a
					>, like
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons"
						>Dungeons & Dragons</a
					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can use paper miniatures however you like. You could make your own
					paper chess set, prototype a new board game, or print some little
					characters from whatever book you're reading as a bedtime story. Have
					fun!
				</p>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>How can I print an SVG?</summary>
				<p>
					You'll need a tool that lets you paste an SVG from your clipboard, and
					arrange it on a page, and export the page as a PDF. You can usually
					fit many different miniatures on a single page.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> is likely the easiest
					option if you're new to vector editing tools.
					<a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> is another option, it's a
					free and open-source vector graphics editor but might have a bit more
					of a learning curve.
				</p>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>How do I assemble a paper mini?</summary>
				<p>You'll need scissors and a glue stick.</p>
				<p>
					First cut along the solid lines. you don’t have to be super exact, a
					little variation is fine. Then fold along the dotted lines.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you’re done each individual fold, fold everything into place to
					see how your paper miniature will look. Finally, glue along the entire
					back of the print to permanently assemble your miniature.
				</p>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>What kinds of images can I use?</summary>
				<p>
					Please source your images responsibly. Most image formats should work
					well. JPEG and PNG are likely best.
				</p>
				<p>
					Images should have a plain white background. This is helpful for
					tracing, and also prints nicely. If you need a way to remove a
					background,
					<a href="https://www.remove.bg/">https://www.remove.bg/</a> works
					well, the small image sizes you get for free are fine for miniature
					sized printing.
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>
					Images should be under 1000 pixels square, otherwise things might be
					really slow. If you need an online image resizing tool, many have
					annoying ads, but
					<a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/image/resize"
						>Adobe Express's resize tool</a
					>
					can be refreshing because it's just one giant ad for Adobe.
				</p>
				<p>
					If your image isn’t working as expected, you can try to tweak the
					silhouette related settings to see if that helps.
				</p>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>Should I use AI-generated images?</summary>
				<p>
					Using generative algorithms to create character artwork is a shortcut.
					I think it's important to consider what you’re cutting out, and the
					nature of the tools you’re using.
				</p>
				<p>
					By their nature, generative algorithms are derivative of existing
					images. To train these algorithms, AI companies download and process,
					without permission, the creative work of many generations of
					hard-working artists. I think it's critically important to acknowledge
					the lifetimes of human labour that underpin these tools. The companies
					that build and sell these tools did not create the words and images
					that power them. These companies seem happy to compromise the
					livelihoods of the same people to whom they owe their existence, all
					in the name of profit and financial progress.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you use generative algorithms, you are cutting out the artist.
					And this is just one issue of many related to generative algorithms.
					It’s up to you to source and create images responsibly.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may be cutting something else out too. The value proposition of
					generative algorithms is that they let you skip a good chunk of the
					creative process. You may find that hand-drawing your own art brings a
					different kind of connection and meaning to what you create. No matter
					how “bad” you might think you are as an artist, there’s no way to know
					what you’re missing until you’ve personally created something you feel
					happy with.
				</p>
				<p>
					I strongly believe that feeling happy with your own artwork doesn’t
					mean it needs to be “good” by any standard. I think that desire for
					“good” artwork, and protection from the feeling that we’re “bad” at
					something, is what drives us to use sloppy and exploitative generative
					tools in the first place.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you focus on a playful and forgiving creative process, your joy
					will be baked into whatever you make, even if it doesn’t have as much
					lipstick as what gets spit out of an image generator.
				</p>

				<summary>How can I support this project?</summary>
				<p>
					If you've gotten something out of the many hours of work that went
					into this tool, you can
					<a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/zchsh">say thanks with money</a>.
					It'll help me buy food and pay my rent.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you'd like to contribute code or feedback, you can do that on
					GitHub at
					<a href="https://github.com/zchsh/paper-mini-gen"
						>zchsh/paper-mini-gen</a
					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The spirit of this project is to make a tool that's open source,
					account-less, does one thing really well, and uses file formats that
					are highly interoperable, so that you can use it in combination with
					other tools. It's an attempt at taking a
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy"
						>Unix-like philosophy</a
					>
					to writing code for the web.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you like writing code, I'd love to hear your thoughts or
					collaborate on tools with a similar philosophy. You can reach me at
					<a href="mailto:hi@zch.sh">hi@zch.sh</a>.
				</p>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>Colophon &amp; thanks</summary>
				<p>
					This project relies on a bunch of open source libraries. A big thanks
					to maintainers of these libraries for making their work freely
					available.
				</p>
